Apply to the scalp before washing your hair. Begin by applying Embodiment all over your scalp, making sure to massage it in well.

In addition, apply small amounts onto the ends of your hair. Once completed leave in for approximately 15-30 minutes.

When done, move onto shampooing and deep conditioning your hair. Before proceeding to style your hair as normal. Double-check you have rinsed out all traces of the shampoo and conditioner from your hair.

> For a more intensive pre-shampoo treatment, I suggest leaving it in your hair overnight. So instead of rinsing out after 15-30 minutes, rinse out the following day.

Then proceed to wash, deep condition and style your hair as normal.
