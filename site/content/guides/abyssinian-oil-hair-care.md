## What is Abyssinian oil?

Abyssinian oil comes from the beautiful flowering plant known as Crambe abyssinica,
originating in Ethopia, Africa, but also grown in the Mediterranean.

## Why use Abyssinian oil in hair care?

It has many applications, but with hair care its properties make it a ["natural 
replacement to synthentic oils like silicones"](https://www.elementis.com/acquiadam/asset/90205652).
Non-soluable silicones need to be washed out with stronger shampoos, leaving the
hair in a dryer state than we'd like.
