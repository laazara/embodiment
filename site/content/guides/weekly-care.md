## Week one

Put a small amount directly onto your scalp once a day. Massage the product into your scalp well. After massaging the product into your scalp, apply the excess into the ends of your hair.

## Week two

During the second week, repeat steps in week one, but concentrating additional amounts into your problem areas.

## Week three

In week three, add product directly to the scalp and include your problem areas. Additionally add product to the ends of your hair. Continue to do this up until the night before, or day of your hair wash.
