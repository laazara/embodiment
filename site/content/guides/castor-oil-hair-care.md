## What is castor oil?

Produced mostly in the tropics of the warm, [Gujarat region of Western India, China and Brazil](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5015816/), castor oil is extracted from its unique-looking castor bean to create soaps, shampoos and industrial lubricants. You may come across two types of castor oil.

- **Regular castor oil** is thinner, odourless, and is rather potent considering its main component is ricinoleic acid which is known for alleviating consipation.
- **[Jamaican Black Castor Oil](https://www.castoroil.co.uk/types-of-castor-oil.html)** is roasted like a coffee bean before the oil is extracted and is popular in hair use. Many note its earthy, ashy smell and it's heavy sticky consistency, even more than jojoba oil.
