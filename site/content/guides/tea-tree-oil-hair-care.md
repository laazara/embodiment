## What is Tea Tree Oil

The distinctly fragrant oil comes from the 2-meter tall tea tree shrub most known to be found on the coasts of southeastern Australia. Originally used by the indigenous Aborigines for medicinal purposes, it has become a well-known essential oil for topical use, aromatherapy and hair care.

It takes 12-15 months for a tree to reach harvesting height from just a seedling before the oil can be extracted from the leaves using [steam distillation](https://ultranl.com/products/tea-tree-oil-south-africa).

## What are the protective benefits of Tea Tree Oil for the scalp?

Tea tree oil is known for its [antibacterial](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378874121007959) and antifungal properties. Our bodies naturally produce sebum, which acts as a protective layer for our hair roots and skin. It protects our skin from dryness and microbes. As shampoos and soaps strip our hair and skin of this natural oil, it makes sense to use moisturizers and oils that include these protective benefits. 

## Tea tree trees don't need pesticides to grow

Not having to use pesticides is great news for hair care as the scalp, with the one of the highest densities of hair follicles on the body, means product chemicals are more quickly absorbed, be they good or bad for us. Less chemicals used in farming means less chemicals found in the end products we use on our skin. Unfortunately, [pesticides](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030881460800784X.) can be found even in food-grade oils. 

One of the benefits of growing tea tree shrubs is that they are [“naturally pest resistant”](https://www.farmersweekly.co.za/crops/field-crops/a-successful-switch-from-grain-to-tea-tree-oil/) and thus don’t require pesticides. In fact, essential oils are considered [good potential pesticides](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7143296/) in themselves.
