### Wash and condition your hair more regularly

How regularly you wash your hair depends on you, your climate, and your hair type. If you find your hair is getting tangled, maybe increase the frequency of washing your hair so you can condition it while damp. Conditioning coats the hair so that the strands glide over each other. That way, while gliding, your hair will be less likely to tangle.

### Keep your hair moisturised

As soon as your hair starts to lose its slipperiness between strands, especially with curly hair, you might find your hair locks up into knots and tangles more quickly. To moisturize your hair, you can use hair creams, oils like our [Embodiment oil](https://embodimentshop.com) and other chemical moisturisers.

### Focus mositurisation on the ends of your hair. 

Chances are, your hair gets tangled more at the ends than closer to the scalp. Focusing on conditioning and moisturising these areas is quicker, so you can maintain hair moisture between washes.

### Deep condition your hair.

Deep conditioning and hair masks allow oils to penetrate and be absorbed deep into the hair shaft. This keeps the hair moisture locked in and the hair fiber strengthened. When a hair strand is strong, it *should* be less likely to break and tangle with other hair strands.

### Mind how you sleep

So maybe you cannot control how you sleep, but as you toss and turn, your hair gets tugged and pulled. This stress on the hair causes damage from the friction against your pillow. How can you overcome this?

- Wearing a silk cap so you're not pulling or rubbing your hair.
- Or use a silk pillow to decrease friction as you sleep.
- Or wearing a protective hairstyle before you sleep, like plaits, twists, or tying your hair up. This reduces the surface area of hair exposed to friction.
