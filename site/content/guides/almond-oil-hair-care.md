## What is almond oil?

### Sweet vs bitter almond oil

When you see a bottle of "almond oil", that actually is a bottle of sweet almond oil, known as a carrier oil in aromatherapy. Sweet almond oil has a lot more applications than the bitter form, especially when used in products for the skin. Bitter almond oil is actually an essential oil, and like [Tea Tree Oil](/guides/tea-tree-oil-hair-care), it's better suited for medical applications because of its antimicrobial properties and if used on the skin, it has to be diluted first with a carrier oil.

### Why is almond oil so popular?

The almond oil industry is almost a staggering [2 trillion US dollar market](https://www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/almond-oil-market), one-quarter the size of the global and very popular [olive oil market](https://www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/olive-oil-market). And why is it so popular? Aside from aromatherapy, people use it for cooking to flavour food as it has a nutty taste, but when refined, it's also very suitable for frying. As for hair care, it can even be found in popular shampoos and hair conditioners.

## Almond oil vs hair damage

When it comes to UV protection, we think of [protecting our skin](https://www.skincancer.org/risk-factors/uv-radiation) using SPF creams. But what about our hair? An article by [Klaudija Sebetic et al](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19138021/) highlighted that sun exposure, especially excessive sun exposure damages our hair in two ways.

- **The loss of hair pigmentation** - which explains the effects of people finding that hair becomes lighter due to being out in the sun, especially after a beach holiday. Some may find this lightening effect rather pleasant, but needless to say, it is a damaging effect.
- **Damage to hair proteins** (such as keratin) which could make our hair weaker and prone to breaking.

And how does Almond oil help? It was found to reduce structural damage caused by ultraviolet radiation in as study on animals by [Yasmin et al](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17348990/) and was found to have an [SPF level of almost 5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3140123/). SPF 5 doesn't sound like a lot, but it [blocks over 75%](https://drbaileyskincare.com/blogs/blog/how-high-of-an-spf-does-your-sunscreen-need-to-have) of the UVB type radiation. It's the [vitmain E](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11139138) in almond oil that carries this anti-UV protection.

## Almond oil as a conditioner

### Almond oil for shiny hair

Almond oil fills in the gaps between the cuticles, flattening the cuticles, adding to the shine of the hair.

### Increased strength for processed hair

Almond oil may increase the strength of the hair because of a fatty molecule called linoleic acid. Almond oil is composed of [13-29%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7520497) linoleic acid which notably increases hair tensile strength as reported by [Si Hyun Lee and Cheunsoon Ahn](https://fashionandtextiles.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40691-021-00282-5) on processed hair. Almond oil is a good option for hair conditioners when trying to limit the damage due to styling processes.

### Almond oil for softness

Almond oil locks in moisture with its "emollient property, and hence can be used to soften and moisturize dry hair" as summarised by Venkataram Mysore and Arpita Arghya on '[Hair Oils: Indigenous Knowledge Revisited](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9231528/
)'.

## Where can you find almond oil?

The sweet almond oil can be found at most supermarkets and possibly even your local shop. However, the essential oil, bitter almond oil may be found at more specialist health shops or on online stores.

## Issues with farming almond trees

Unfortunately, [almond oil farming is unsustainable](https://www.healabel.com/almond-oil-side-effects) as it has a high carbon foot print in comparison to other foods and harms [bees](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/28/what-plant-milk-should-i-drink-almond-killing-bees-aoe). Nonetheless work on [improving its sustainability](https://citizensustainable.com/almonds-environment/) has begun after criticism of growing almond trees over other nut trees.
