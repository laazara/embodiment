## What is almond oil?

### Sweet vs bitter almond oil

When you see a bottle of "almond oil", that actually is a bottle of sweet almond oil, known as a carrier oil in aromatherapy. Sweet almond oil has a lot more applications than the bitter form, especially when used in products for the skin. Bitter almond oil is actually an essential oil, and like [Tea Tree Oil](/guides/tea-tree-oil-hair-care), it's better suited for medical applications because of its antimicrobial properties and if used on the skin, it has to be diluted first with a carrier oil.

### Why is almond oil so popular?

The almond oil industry is almost a staggering [2 trillion US dollar market](https://www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/almond-oil-market), one-quarter the size of the global and very popular [olive oil market](https://www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/olive-oil-market). And why is it so popular? Aside from aromatherapy, people use it for cooking to flavour food as it has a nutty taste, but when refined, it's also very suitable for frying. As for hair care, it can even be found in popular shampoos and hair conditioners.

## Almond oil vs hair damage

When it comes to UV protection, we think of [protecting our skin](https://www.skincancer.org/risk-factors/uv-radiation) using SPF creams. But what about our hair? An article by [Klaudija Sebetic et al](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19138021/) highlighted that sun exposure, especially excessive sun exposure damages our hair in two ways.

- **The loss of hair pigmentation** - which explains the effects of people finding that hair becomes lighter due to being out in the sun, especially after a beach holiday. Some may find this lightening effect rather pleasant, but needless to say, it is a damaging effect.
- **Damage to hair proteins** (such as keratin) which could make our hair weaker and prone to breaking.

And how does Almond oil help? It was found to reduce structural damage caused by ultraviolet radiation in as study on animals by [Yasmin et al](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17348990/) and was found to have an [SPF level of almost 5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3140123/). SPF 5 doesn't sound like a lot, but it [blocks over 75%](https://drbaileyskincare.com/blogs/blog/how-high-of-an-spf-does-your-sunscreen-need-to-have) of the UVB type radiation. It's the [vitmain E](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11139138) in almond oil that carries this anti-UV protection.
