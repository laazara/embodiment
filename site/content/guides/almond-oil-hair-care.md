## What is almond oil?

### Sweet vs bitter almond oil

Almond oil usually refers to the sweet kind which can be used in cooking as well as hair and cosmetics. Sweet almond oil has a lot more applications than the bitter form and can be applied directly on the skin and scalp.

Bitter almond oil is an essential oil. Like [Tea Tree Oil](/guides/tea-tree-oil-hair-care), bitter almond oil is better suited for medical applications because of its antimicrobial properties. It is also beneficial for hair and cosmetics but only when it is diluted first.

## The benefits of almond oil for hair care

- Almond oil is light as opposed to heavier oils like Jamaican castor oil - so it's suited for thinner hair types.
- It's fast absorbing so it can be applied to the skin or hair easily.
- It adds a nice sheen to the hair.
- It can soften the hair.
- Some use it to help avoid brittle hair ends.
- It's great at locking in moisture into the hair.
- Some report their hair appears stronger after daily usage.
- When cold-pressed, almond oil retains more of its nutrients and beneficial fatty acids.
- It's a great carrier oil for aromatic essential oils which provide anti-microbial benefits when used on the skin, scalp or hair.

## How can almond oil be used?

- It's noted to work well as a deep conditioner or hair mask after shampooing.
- It can be used with a traditional chemical conditioner treatment before washing out.
- Some use it as a moisturiser, especially for hair ends to protect from splits and reduce frizziness.
- There are people who use it as part of a hot oil treatment.

## Almond oil vs hair damage

[Sun exposure can damage our hair](/guides/hair-damage/#hair-and-uv-damage). So how does it help prevent sun damage? Almond oil has been found to reduce structural damage to the hair strands themselves caused by ultraviolet radiation in a study on animals by [Yasmin et al](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17348990/). Another study found that almond oil has an [SPF level of almost 5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3140123/). SPF 5 doesn't sound like a lot, but it [blocks over 75%](https://drbaileyskincare.com/blogs/blog/how-high-of-an-spf-does-your-sunscreen-need-to-have) of UVB-type radiation. It's [vitamin E](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11139138) in almond oil that carries this anti-UV protection.

## Almond oil as a conditioner

### Almond oil is great for shiny hair

Almond oil fills in the gaps between the cuticles, flattening the cuticles, adding to the shine of the hair. When the cuticles of our hair are flat, it reflects more light, hence, providing the shiny quality associated with many oils.

### Almond oil promotes the strength of processed hair

Almond oil may increase the strength of the hair because of a fatty acid molecule called linoleic acid. Almond oil is composed of [13-29%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7520497) linoleic acid which notably increases hair tensile strength as reported by [Si Hyun Lee and Cheunsoon Ahn](https://fashionandtextiles.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40691-021-00282-5) on processed hair. Almond oil is a good option for hair conditioners when trying to limit the damage due to styling processes.

### Almond oil softens the hair.

Almond oil locks in moisture with its "emollient property, and hence can be used to soften and moisturize dry hair" as summarised by Venkataram Mysore and Arpita Arghya on '[Hair Oils: Indigenous Knowledge Revisited](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9231528/
)'.
