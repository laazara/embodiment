        <h2>How We Collect Your Data</h2>
        <p>
          We do this in a number of ways. Including, when you share your information with us to make
          an online purchase or create an account. Be assured, we treat your data with the utmost
          care. And take appropriate steps to protect it.

          Sometimes we will share data with third parties. This help us to provide a better service
          for you. Some examples might be, giving your address to a courier, so they can deliver
          your order. Or to another company who are supplying you with a service.
